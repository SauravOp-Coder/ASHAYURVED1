                    Vaman (or Vamana Karma) is one of the five detoxification therapies in Panchakarma—a core part of Ayurvedic medicine. It refers to therapeutic emesis, or medically induced vomiting, and is used to eliminate excess Kapha dosha from the body.

                    Purpose of Vaman:
                    
                    Vaman is recommended when there's an accumulation of Kapha in the body, leading to conditions like:
                    
                    Asthma
                    
                    Chronic allergies
                    
                    Obesity
                    
                    Skin disorders (like psoriasis)
                    
                    Sinusitis

                    An Ayurvedic facial is a rejuvenating skincare therapy that uses natural, herbal, and plant-based ingredients customized to your dosha (body constitution—Vata, Pitta, or Kapha). This gentle yet effective facial focuses on cleansing, exfoliating, nourishing, and balancing the skin using traditional Ayurvedic techniques.

Key Elements:

Cleansing: Uses herbal cleansers like rose water, turmeric, or neem to purify the skin and remove toxins.

Exfoliation: Natural scrubs made with ingredients like chickpea flour, sandalwood, or lentil powder gently remove dead skin cells.

Massage: A relaxing facial massage with warm herbal oils (such as sesame, almond, or jojoba) improves circulation, tones facial muscles, and promotes lymphatic drainage.

Mask: A customized herbal mask is applied based on the skin’s dosha type to hydrate, soothe, or detoxify.

Steam Therapy: Often infused with Ayurvedic herbs like tulsi or lavender to open pores and enhance product absorption.

Aromatherapy: Essential oils may be used to calm the mind and balance emotions.


Benefits:

Restores natural glow and skin clarity

Improves skin texture and elasticity

Reduces signs of aging

Detoxifies and deeply nourishes the skin

                    2. Exfoliation: A scrub is massaged onto the body in circular motions to slough off dead skin cells and stimulate blood circulation.
                    
                    
                    3. Rinsing: The scrub is rinsed off, usually with a warm shower or damp towels.
                    
                    
                    4. Moisturizing: A nourishing body lotion or oil is applied to hydrate and soothe the skin.

                    Kshar Sutra Therapy – Ayurvedic Para-surgical Procedure
                    
                    Definition:
                    Kshar Sutra is a minimally invasive Ayurvedic technique used primarily for the treatment of fistula-in-ano, piles (hemorrhoids), and other anorectal disorders. It involves the use of a specially medicated thread (Kshar Sutra) prepared with herbs like Apamarga Kshara, Snuhi latex, and Haridra (turmeric).
                    
                    Procedure:
                    
                    The medicated thread is carefully inserted into the fistulous tract or around the pile mass.
                    
                    It gradually cuts, drains, and heals the tract or tissue while delivering herbal medicine locally.
                    
                    The thread is changed weekly until complete healing.
                    <br>
                    <h3>Benefits of Kshar Sutra:</h3>

Proven high success rate in treating fistula-in-ano with minimal recurrence.

Useful in internal and external hemorrhoids (especially 2nd and 3rd degree).

2. Minimally Invasive:

<br>
3. Less Risk of Recurrence:

<br>
4. Cost-Effective and Outpatient-Friendly:

Can be performed on an outpatient basis.

Less hospital stay and quicker recovery.
<br>


5. Anti-inflammatory and Antibacterial Action:

Reduces local infection, inflammation, and promotes faster healing.

<br>

6. Safe and Natural:

Fewer side effects compared to conventional surgery.

<br>

7. Gradual Cutting and Healing:

The tract is cut slowly while simultaneously healing from behind, leaving minimal scarring.
